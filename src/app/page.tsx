                    <strong>Choosing a chef's knife:</strong> Your chef's knife
                    is your ally in the kitchen. You'll use it every day, every
                    time you cook, so make sure you buy one that feels
                    comfortable in your hand: not too heavy or too light, not
                    too long or too short, just right. If you can, go to a store
                    that has several different kinds and brands of chef's knives
                    and give them all a try. But remember: you only need one
                    solid knife.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Your knife should be sharp!</strong> Next up, make
                    sure your knife is sharp and honed. It should be able to cut
                    through ingredients cleanly and easily without needing to
                    use a lot of force. If it doesn't, take it to a professional
                    knife sharpener to get it fixed up. If you had your knife
                    sharpened recently, it may just need to be honed on a honing
                    steel to straighten out the edge.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>How to hold the knife.</strong> Good knife skills
                    start with holding the knife properly. Pinch the blade of
                    the knife where it meets the handle between your thumb and
                    first finger, then wrap the rest of your fingers around the
                    handle. (Do not lay your first finger across the top of the
                    blade.) This position will give you the most leverage and
                    control as you cut and dice. It might feel a little awkward
                    at first, but if you keep practicing holding your knife this
                    way, it will quickly start to feel natural. Watch the video
                    above to really see how this is done.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>
                      Use "The Claw" to protect your other hand.
                    </strong>{" "}
                    Be sure to protect your other hand as you cut: use "The
                    Claw" position. Curl the fingers of your opposite hand into
                    a "claw" and rest just the tips of your fingers on top of
                    the ingredient you're about to cut. Tuck your thumb in; your
                    wrist should be parallel to the cutting board. As you slice,
                    move your fingers back, still keeping this claw formation.
                    If your knife slips as you cut, it will hit against your
                    knuckles or fingernails, protecting you from a serious
                    slice.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Stabilize your cutting board.</strong> Last but not
                    least, stabilize your cutting board by placing a rubber mat
                    or a damp paper towel underneath. This will keep it from
                    slipping as you cut, helping you work more quickly and
                    safely.

                    <strong>Choosing a chef's knife:</strong> Your chef's knife
                    is your ally in the kitchen. You'll use it every day, every
                    time you cook, so make sure you buy one that feels
                    comfortable in your hand: not too heavy or too light, not
                    too long or too short, just right. If you can, go to a store
                    that has several different kinds and brands of chef's knives
                    and give them all a try. But remember: you only need one
                    solid knife.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Your knife should be sharp!</strong> Next up, make
                    sure your knife is sharp and honed. It should be able to cut
                    through ingredients cleanly and easily without needing to
                    use a lot of force. If it doesn't, take it to a professional
                    knife sharpener to get it fixed up. If you had your knife
                    sharpened recently, it may just need to be honed on a honing
                    steel to straighten out the edge.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>How to hold the knife.</strong> Good knife skills
                    start with holding the knife properly. Pinch the blade of
                    the knife where it meets the handle between your thumb and
                    first finger, then wrap the rest of your fingers around the
                    handle. (Do not lay your first finger across the top of the
                    blade.) This position will give you the most leverage and
                    control as you cut and dice. It might feel a little awkward
                    at first, but if you keep practicing holding your knife this
                    way, it will quickly start to feel natural. Watch the video
                    above to really see how this is done.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>
                      Use "The Claw" to protect your other hand.
                    </strong>{" "}
                    Be sure to protect your other hand as you cut: use "The
                    Claw" position. Curl the fingers of your opposite hand into
                    a "claw" and rest just the tips of your fingers on top of
                    the ingredient you're about to cut. Tuck your thumb in; your
                    wrist should be parallel to the cutting board. As you slice,
                    move your fingers back, still keeping this claw formation.
                    If your knife slips as you cut, it will hit against your
                    knuckles or fingernails, protecting you from a serious
                    slice.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Stabilize your cutting board.</strong> Last but not
                    least, stabilize your cutting board by placing a rubber mat
                    or a damp paper towel underneath. This will keep it from
                    slipping as you cut, helping you work more quickly and
                    safely.

                    <strong>Choosing a chef's knife:</strong> Your chef's knife
                    is your ally in the kitchen. You'll use it every day, every
                    time you cook, so make sure you buy one that feels
                    comfortable in your hand: not too heavy or too light, not
                    too long or too short, just right. If you can, go to a store
                    that has several different kinds and brands of chef's knives
                    and give them all a try. But remember: you only need one
                    solid knife.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Your knife should be sharp!</strong> Next up, make
                    sure your knife is sharp and honed. It should be able to cut
                    through ingredients cleanly and easily without needing to
                    use a lot of force. If it doesn't, take it to a professional
                    knife sharpener to get it fixed up. If you had your knife
                    sharpened recently, it may just need to be honed on a honing
                    steel to straighten out the edge.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>How to hold the knife.</strong> Good knife skills
                    start with holding the knife properly. Pinch the blade of
                    the knife where it meets the handle between your thumb and
                    first finger, then wrap the rest of your fingers around the
                    handle. (Do not lay your first finger across the top of the
                    blade.) This position will give you the most leverage and
                    control as you cut and dice. It might feel a little awkward
                    at first, but if you keep practicing holding your knife this
                    way, it will quickly start to feel natural. Watch the video
                    above to really see how this is done.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>
                      Use "The Claw" to protect your other hand.
                    </strong>{" "}
                    Be sure to protect your other hand as you cut: use "The
                    Claw" position. Curl the fingers of your opposite hand into
                    a "claw" and rest just the tips of your fingers on top of
                    the ingredient you're about to cut. Tuck your thumb in; your
                    wrist should be parallel to the cutting board. As you slice,
                    move your fingers back, still keeping this claw formation.
                    If your knife slips as you cut, it will hit against your
                    knuckles or fingernails, protecting you from a serious
                    slice.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Stabilize your cutting board.</strong> Last but not
                    least, stabilize your cutting board by placing a rubber mat
                    or a damp paper towel underneath. This will keep it from
                    slipping as you cut, helping you work more quickly and
                    safely.
